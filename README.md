# Standard Cortical Observer - Model Repository

The SCO Model Repository is a registry for computational models that predict brain responses to arbitrary sensory inputs.

Each model in the registry defines the set of expected input parameters and the set of outputs that are produced.

Registered models are available through the SCO Web API and the Web UI.
